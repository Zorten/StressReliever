# StressReliever
## Purpose
Welcome to Stress Reliever! This is an interactive project whose purpose is to relieve anxiety and stress by engaging you and distracting you from your worries, even if just for a second. I was inspired to do this project because of the loved ones around me who get overtaken by anxiety, and also because of my continuously high levels of stress. With this project, I hope to alleviate these overwhelming feelings.
This version of Stress Reliever comes with 4 main functions:

* Breathing Exercise
* Motivational Phrases
* Song Melodies
* Arcade Game

Any one of these can be selected and played around with. The Breathing Exercise function instructs you to inhale, hold your breath, and then exhale. This is meant to help you control your breathing and heart rate if you feel like they are out of control. The Motivational Phrases function displays some pre-loaded phrases that are meant to cheer you up a bit. The Song Melodies function plays tune melodies of some songs, with the hopes of distracting you and getting the melody stuck in your head. Lastly, the Arcade Game function allows you to play a game I created for my past project, Labitynth! In this game, you must traverse the maze and reach the exit without dying.
